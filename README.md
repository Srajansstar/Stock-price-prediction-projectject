# Stock-price-prediction-project

**Overview**
This project aims to predict stock prices using various machine-learning models. It was developed as part of my learning journey in Data Science during my college studies. The project explores different algorithms and techniques for forecasting stock prices based on historical data.

**Features**
Data collection and preprocessing,
,Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
,Implementation of Linear Regression and SVM models
,Model evaluation and performance comparison.

**Dataset**
The dataset used in this project consists of historical stock prices, including features like Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume. The data was sourced from Yahoo Finance using the yfinance library.
